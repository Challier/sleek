Hi there,

I'm Victor, a 24 years old Data Scientist, living in Paris. I started this blog to give to whoever is interested a quick overview of the projects I have completed recently.

I'm working with two friends on a project called [Dacker](https://www.dacker.co "Our project's Website"). The three of us work Freelance, and we can push forward your next Data Sciences project. Do you have an idea you'd like to discuss? Please [email me](mailto:{{site.email}}), and I'll get back to you as soon as possible!

Cheers
